Practical 1
*Angular Component + One-Way Data Binding + ngIf
Aim:
To create an Angular component and demonstrate one-way data binding and *ngIf directive.
Steps:
Step 1: Create Angular Application
ng new myApp
cd myApp
ng serve
Step 2: Create Component
ng generate component student
Step 3: Write Code in student.component.ts
import { Component } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;
@Component({
selector: &#39;app-student&#39;,
templateUrl: &#39;./student.component.html&#39;
})
export class StudentComponent {
studentName = &#39;Rahul&#39;;
show = true;
}
Step 4: Write Code in student.component.html
&lt;h2 *ngIf=&quot;show&quot;&gt;Student Name: {{ studentName }}&lt;/h2&gt;
Step 5: Use Component Selector in app.component.html
&lt;app-student&gt;&lt;/app-student&gt;
Output:
Student name is displayed only when condition is true.
Result:
Thus, Angular component, one-way data binding and *ngIf directive are implemented
successfully.
